Code Refractor

I was given a starter code for a desktop view of a website named Horiseon. My task was to clean up, refractor and add to the overall code to enhance the user experience.

What i did:
In the index HTML file, I made the code more readable by changing the div elements to their respectable names for each aspect of the web page. An example of this is; changing three of the sections of the web page from it's "div" elements to "sections". I also added alt tags to the image URLs, describing each image to inform the viewer and commenting on each section of code to easily navigate to the line of code of the readers choice.

For the css file, I have added comments to specify the styling of each part of the web page, and that I have combined the styling of certain elements to shorten the code.
